        "Theory Questions\n",
        "\n",
        "1. What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and simplicity. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Python is popular due to its extensive standard library, ease of learning, versatility, and large community support. It is widely used in web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "-  An interpreter in Python is a program that executes Python code line-by-line. It translates Python code into machine code (or bytecode) and runs it, allowing developers to execute and test code quickly. Python's interpreter enables interactive coding and debugging through its interactive shell.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Pre-defined keywords in Python are reserved words that have special meanings and purposes in the language. These keywords are part of Python's syntax and cannot be used as identifiers (variable names, function names, etc.). Examples include if, else, while, for, def, class, try, except, import, True, False, None, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "\n",
        "- No, keywords cannot be used as variable names in Python. They are reserved for specific syntactic purposes and using them as identifiers will result in a syntax error.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Mutability refers to the ability of an object to be changed after it is created. Mutable objects can have their content altered, whereas immutable objects cannot. In Python, lists and dictionaries are examples of mutable objects, while strings and tuples are examples of immutable objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Lists are mutable because they are designed to be flexible and allow modifications, such as adding, removing, or changing elements. This is useful for scenarios where the data needs to be dynamic. Tuples are immutable because they are often used to represent fixed collections of items. Their immutability provides performance benefits and ensures data integrity by preventing unintended modifications.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is the difference between == and is operators in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- The == operator checks for value equality, meaning it evaluates whether the values of two objects are equal. The is operator checks for identity equality, meaning it evaluates whether two objects are the same object in memory (i.e., have the same memory address). While == compares contents, is compares identity.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Logical operators in Python are used to combine conditional statements. They include:\n",
        "\n",
        "and: Returns True if both operands are true.\n",
        "or: Returns True if at least one operand is true.\n",
        "not: Inverts the truth value of the operand.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Type casting in Python refers to converting a variable from one data type to another. This is often done to ensure compatibility between different operations or to explicitly define the data type of a variable. Type casting can be implicit or explicit.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Implicit type casting occurs automatically when Python converts one data type to another during an operation, such as adding an integer to a float, resulting in a float.\n",
        "Explicit type casting is performed manually by the programmer using functions like int(), float(), str(), etc., to convert data types intentionally.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Conditional statements in Python, such as if, elif, and else, are used to execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions. They allow the program to make decisions and perform actions selectively, enabling flow control based on logical conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "\n",
        "- The elif statement stands for \"else if\" and is used in conjunction with if and else to test multiple conditions sequentially. If the preceding if condition is false, the program evaluates the elif condition. If any elif condition is true, its corresponding block of code is executed, and subsequent elif or else blocks are skipped.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "\n",
        "- A for loop iterates over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, string, or range) and executes a block of code for each element. It is commonly used when the number of iterations is known beforehand. A while loop continues to execute a block of code as long as its condition is true. It is suitable for scenarios where the number of iterations is not predetermined and depends on the condition being met.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
        "\n",
        "- A while loop is more suitable when you need to keep iterating based on a condition rather than a fixed sequence. For example, if you are reading input from a user until they enter a specific value or condition, a while loop is ideal:\n",
        "\n",
        "    user_input = \"\"\n",
        "    while user_input.lower() != \"exit\":\n",
        "    user_input = input(\"Enter something (type 'exit' to quit): \")\n",
        "    print(f\"You entered: {user_input}\")\n",
        "\n",
